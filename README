This repository is for the development of a Qt version of SCIRun's GUI, to be released with SCIRun v5.

Some new user interactions worth mentioning:
* To add modules to the network, use drag-and-drop from the "module selector" tree on the left hand side of the window.
* To make connections, use the left mouse button to drag between desired ports.
* To execute a network, click the "Execute All" button or use the Ctrl-E hotkey.
* Execution of individual modules (rather than the entire network) is disabled for now.
* Saving and loading of network files is enabled. The file format is xml, but it is not compatible with SCIRun 4, so a *.srn5 extension is used. 
* SCIRun v4 networks are not compatible yet, either. This feature will be implemented in a later milestone release.
* There are many menu options and GUI elements that do nothing yet. They are either grayed out or have an asterisk next to their name.
* You can filter the module selector's list, either with a simple starting string or a wildcard pattern.
* In addition to the basic "Euclidean" connection pipes, a "Cubic Bezier"-style connection is available as an option in the Network Editor tab of the Configuration pane.
* Execution progress is shown in a progress bar as in SCIRun v4.
* Each module widget has an actions button, that contains common actions that used to appear in the right-click menu.
* Double-click a connection to bring up its action menu.
* Deleting objects from the network editor uses Delete on Windows and Fn-Del on MacOS.
* New working module: SolveLinearSystem--uses the parallel linear algebra library of SCIRun v4 for a fast CG solver method.
* Help mode: click the "What's This" button and then click anywhere in the interface for helpful information.
* Networks can be loaded from the command line, and automatically executed with the -e and -E options as in SCIRun v4 (useful for scripting).
* LatVols can be rendered with a brand new rendering engine.

New in milestone D:
* Multithreaded network execution. Access this by opening the developer console (hotkey '`'), and choosing "Parallel."
* Python integration, phase 1. Currently only works with Python 3.3. Turn on "BUILD_WITH_PYTHON" in CMake. You get a Python interpreter in the GUI with a few working commands for network building.
* TriSurfMeshes can now be rendered.
* Network editor provenance: another new window, accessible under the Window menu, allows undo and redo of basic network editor actions.
* The network editor background color can be customized, and is saved as a preference.
* Modules in the network editor now have a notes editor. The notes have a few formatting and position options as in SCIRun v4. They are not saved with the network yet; to be delivered in milestone E.
* Duplicate module is available as a general module action.
