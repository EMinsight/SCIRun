This release of SCIRun 5 Prototype ("Artemis") has limited viewied capabilities powered by VTK.  To take use this feature, VTK must be built with Qt support turned on.  Then, build SCIRunGUIPrototype with VTK support turned on.  Once this is done, a render window option becomes available in the Window menu.  To view a vector field, one must hook up a set of modules as shown in the src/ExampleNets/helixWithVTK.srn5 network file.  The matrix format for the vector field and underlying implementation of the modules is very special, and if you want to try it out with your own data, please contact Dan at dwhite@sci.utah.edu, with [SCIRunPrototype] in the subject line.
