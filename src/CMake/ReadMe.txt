DESCRIPTION
===========

SCIRun is a problem solving environment or "computational workbench" in which a user selects software modules that can be connected in a visual programing environment to create a high level workï¬‚ow for experimentation. Each module exposes all the available parameters necessary for scientists to adjust the outcome of their simulation or visualization. The networks in SCIRun are flexible enough to enable duplication of networks and creation of new modules.
